### Integrating Asynchrony

We've dealt a lot with IO values, but in practice, we may have to deal with legacy 
codebases that use futures or other async structres. But since we are writing pure functional 
programs, we need a way to be able to capture or lift the result of these asynchronous computations into an IO.

Cats effect provides that capability via the `IO.async` method. The way this works is that the method takes a function from a callback 
to Unit, where the callback itself is a funtion from an Either[Throwable,A] to Unit.

The function signature looks like this 
```scala
def async[A](k : (Either[Throwable,A] => Unit ) => Unit)
```

The function signature may 
seem a little daunting, but the basic idea is that you call the method and complete the callback at the 
end of the computation wih either a `Left` or a `Right`

Now, for a contrived exampple, let's imagine we have an asynchronous method that returns an Int, 
and we want to lift that into an IO, we could do it like this:
```scala
object IOAsyncExample extends IOApp {
  val ec = Executors.newCachedThreadPool()

  def getMagicNumber() : Int = {
    Thread.sleep(500)
    43
  }

  def asynComputation =  ec.submit{
    new Callable[Int] {
      override def call(): Int = getMagicNumber()
    }
  }

  val magicIO =  IO.async[Int]{ cb =>
    try cb {
      val result = Right(
        asynComputation.get(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
      )
      ec.shutdown()
      result
    }
    catch {
      case NonFatal(e) => cb(Left(e))
    }
  }

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = {
    for {
      _           <- IO(println("Let's calculate the magic number"))
      magicNumber <- magicIO
      _           <- IO(println(s"magic number is $magicNumber"))
    } yield ExitCode.Success
  }
}
```
With this, we've been able to encapsulate or lift our async computation into an IO. This is more or less the basis for
the utility method to lift a future into an IO: `IO.fromFuture`

> IO.async provides a callback cb so the API (however asynchronous) can signal the result of the
computation.  When the API computes the result it provides it to the callback
